## Usage

The PokeApp allows you to browse and explore Pokémon. You can see basic info about each Pokemon in the table. By clicking on a row in the table, a infobox with the Pokemon's detailed stats will show up. You can navigate to other pokemons by clicking on them in the table, or use the up/down arrow key on the keyboard to go to the previous/next pokemon.
